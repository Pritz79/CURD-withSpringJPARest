# CURD-withSpringJPARest
This  small project in which we can done CRUD operation using Spring MVC. Also in this we don't need to make sevice layer for each entity(that is making service class and 
providing its implementation) I simply create a Employee repository and by extending JPA repository init we can access all the functions that are present in JPA repository.
