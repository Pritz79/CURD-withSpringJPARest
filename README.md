# CURD-withSpringJPARest
This is small project in which we can done CURD operation using Spring MVC. Also in this we don't need to make sevice layer for each entity(that is making service class and providing its implementation) I simply create a Employee repository and by extending JPA repository init we can access all the functions that are present in JPA repository.
This is a simple Spring project that demonstrates how to use JPA repository for CRUD operation. The project is built using Spring Boot and utilizes Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database.
